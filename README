# About

This is a test and template that makes use of the Password and Key Storage API 
of the Haiku operating system, introduced to the BeOS API for R1. It creates 
its own keyring in order to manage its own keys. This app responds depending
on the number of keys and if there is a key set as default (this option is
saved in a flattened BMessage), summonning the "Add Key" dialog (no keys),
"Select Key" dialog (no default key), and directly the app (default key was
configured).
